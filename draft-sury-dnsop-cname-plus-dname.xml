    <abstract>
      <t>This document updates RFC1034 to allow coexistence of the CNAME
      Resource Record with DNAME Resource Record at the same owner node, which
      provides redirection for a sub-tree of the domain name tree in the DNS
      system, in a parent zone.  By allowing this cooexistence, DNS system will
      have a way how to create a sub-tree redirection together that includes the
      Resource Records owner name.  This would allow parent zones to create full
      domain aliases.
      </t>
    </abstract>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
	<xref target="RFC1034">RFC&nbsp;1034</xref> defines CNAME
	resource record for cases when there are multiple names for
	single host.  A CNAME resource record identifies its owner
	name as an alias, and specifies the corresponding canonical
	name in the RDATA section of the resource record.  If a CNAME
	resource record is present at a node, no other data MUST be
	present; this ensures that the data for a canonical name and
	its aliases cannot be different.  This rule also insures that
	a cached CNAME can be used without checking with an
	authoritative server for other resource record types.
      </t>
      <t>
	However there is already existing exceptions to this
	rule.  <xref target="RFC4034">RFC&nbsp;4034</xref> defines
	exception to RRSIG and NSEC records, which MUST exist for the
	same name as a CNAME resource record in a signed zone.
      </t>

      <t>
	<xref target="RFC6672">RFC&nbsp;6672</xref> defines DNAME
	resource record, which provides redirection for a sub-tree of
	the domain name tree in the DNS system.  That is, all names
	that end with a particular suffix are redirected to another
	part of the DNS.
      </t>

      <t>
	The DNAME RR and the CNAME RR <xref target="RFC1034">RFC&nbsp;1034</xref>
	cause a lookup to (potentially) return data corresponding to a
	domain name different from the queried domain name.  The
	difference between the two resource records is that the CNAME
	RR directs the lookup of data at its owner to another single
	name, a DNAME RR directs lookups for data at descendents of
	its owner's name to corresponding names under a different
	(single) node of the tree.
      </t>

      <section title="Terminology">
	<t>
	  All the basic terms used in this specification are defined
	  in the documents <xref target="RFC1034">RFC&nbsp;1034</xref>,
	  <xref target="RFC1035">RFC&nbsp;1035</xref>, and
	  <xref target="RFC6672">RFC&nbsp;6672</xref>.
	</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Requirements Language">
	<t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
          "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
          and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
          described in <xref target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Motivation">
      <t>
	In some languages, some characters has the variants, which
	look differently or very similar but are identical in the
	meaning.  For example, Chinese character U+56FD and its
	variant U+570B look differently, but are identical in the
	meaning.  If Internationalized Domain Label or "IDL"
	<xref target="RFC3743">RFC&nbsp;3743</xref> are composed of
	variant characters, we regard this kind of IDL as the IDL
	variant.  If these IDL variants are put into the DNS for
	resolution, they are expected to be identical in the DNS
	resolution.  More comprehensible example is that we expect
	color.example.com to be equivalent with the colour.example.com
	in the DNS resolution.  Currently this is something we are
	unable to achieve without copying the data for the owner of
	the domain record (ie. for the color.example.com) and keeping
	it in sync by some external mechanism.  The CNAME+DNAME record
	placed in the parent zone will remove this need for
	synchronization.  Without this bundling mechanism, current
	mechanisms such as DNAME or CNAME are not enough capable to
	solve all the problems with the emergence of internationalized
	domain names.  The internationalized domain names may have
	alias or equivalence of the original one.
      </t>
      <t>
	The CNAME+DNAME is not limited to internationalized domain
	names.  This bundling could be used by TLD registries to offer
	additional service for it's registrants.  F.e. a hosting
	company could create generic record for it's service and with
	simple CNAME+DNAME bundle it can create all needed DNS
	resource records for providing this service.
      </t>
      <t>
	There are already such uses of CNAME which violates existing
	DNS standards by replying with CNAME records in the apex of
	the zone.  This proposal would allow these perpetrators to
	comply with the DNS standard again.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="CNAME+DNAME Bundle">
      <t>
	This proposal doesn't change wire formats of the existing
	CNAME and DNAME records.  It also doesn't change handling of
	the CNAME and DNAME on the resolver side.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Query processing">
      <t>
	Existing rules for a DNAME RR and a CNAME RR are still valid
	with following exception: The DNAME and CNAME resource records
	MAY co-exist at the same owner name in the parent zone.
      </t>
      <section title="Processing by Authoritative Servers">
	<t>
	  The authoritative server implementations MUST allow CNAME
	  record when there is a DNAME record for the same name and
	  vice versa.
	</t>
	<t>
	  The authoritative server implementations compliant with this
	  specification SHOULD add an associated DNAME record into an ADDITIONAL
	  (or ANSWER?) section for any non-DNAME query along with the CNAME
	  record that would be normally required.  This would allow recursive
	  DNS server implementation that understand the DNAME record to
	  synthetize the answers for the subtree directly without making an
	  additional queries to the respective authoritative DNS servers.
	</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Processing by Recursive Servers">
	<t>
	  The recursive server implementations MUST NOT deny CNAME
	  record when there is a DNAME record already present in the
	  cache for the same name and vice versa.
	</t>
	<t>
	  The recursive DNS server implementation SHOULD accept the extra DNAME
	  resource record that would be returned along with the CNAME record in
	  the ADDITIONAL (or ANSWER?) section.
	</t>
      </section>

    <section anchor="Implementation" title="Implementation Report">
      <t>
	The author has implemented a change for BIND 9 authoritative server
	during the IETF Hackathon in Montreal, and the domain with CNAME+DNAME
	can be tested at www.cname-plus-dname.rocks.
      </t>
      <t>
	The conducted experiment confirmed that BIND, Unbound and Google Public
	DNS work fine, Knot Resolver has a bug that makes the DNS answer contain
	the DNAME records, but with RCODE=SERVFAIL, and PowerDNS returns
	RCODE=SERVFAIL for any DNAME query.  The other public DNS
	implementations follow the errors of their respective deployed software.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>
	In case the recursive DNS server looking for records has enabled DNS
	Query Name Minimization (<xref target="RFC7816">RFC&nbsp;7816</xref>),
	the CNAME+DNAME specification might make the resolver send one more
	label than needed from the original DNS Query Name to the nameservers
	authoritative for the CNAME+DNAME records unless the authoritative DNS
	server preemptively returns DNAME record along with the CNAME resource
	record for the minimized query, and at the same time the recursive DNS
	server understand the additional data in the answer and utilizes it to
	synthetize the answer.
